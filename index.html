        <h1>Golden Flag Awards</h1>
        <h2>Celebrating the best in Capture the Flag from 2014</h2>
      </div>
      <div id='main'>
		  <p>The Golden Flag Awards are a new tradition started at the end of 2014 to honor the best in the year's CTF challenges and events. This is a bit of an experiment and based on community feedback, it's possible things will change for next year. </p>
		  <p>The actual award ceremony will be held Saturday, January 17th at 1800 EST at the <a href="http://shmoocon.org/">ShmooCon conference</a> in Washington, DC, but will be streamed online.  Check back here for more information closer to the appointed time.</p>

		  <h1>Current Categories</h1>
		  <p>A large list of nomination categories was shared with the CTF community and based on the feedback from that survey, the most popular categories for awards for final voting were selected. They are:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>CTF: Most Fun</li>
			  <li>CTF: Most Innovative</li>
			  <li>Challenge: Most Difficult/Complicated</li>
			  <li>Challenge: Most Fun</li>
			  <li>Challegne: Best Crypto</li>
			  <li>Challenge: Best pwnable</li>
			  <li>Most unexpected solution</li>
			  <li>Best tool made for CTF</li>
			  <li>Top CTF Time Team</li>
		  </ul>
        
		  <p>First, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10dRYFExlDHRXcuCm9fN3zBOW-Qez9Qh5aj62TkuBToU/viewform">VOTE</a>. If you have any questions, the best way to talk to us is look us up with our twitter handles below.</p>
        
		<h1>Transparency and Background </h1>
		<p>One of the primary goals of this process is to be transparent. We've received some questions about how teams were selected for the vote. A nomination form that was advertised the same way as the vote (via twitter, IRC) was posted in December so everyone would have time to contribute. We've since made <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gdF2YfTmucBniXIwTgmqGZK_BpoFky-a2cqnNGW6PFs/edit?usp=sharing">those results</a> public. Additionally, as soon as the award ceremony is finished, we'll publish the final results spreadsheet as well.</p>
		<p>This website was only recently finished. In a perfect world, we would have had the website with more information before the nomination process which might have helped generate better feedback. We apologize for that, but that shouldn't be a problem next year and the community should be more familiar with the process by then. Additionally, we'll announce the timeline for next year in advance.</p>
		</p>We didn't expect this process to go perfectly the first time, but wanted to get the ball rolling. Hopefully it works well enough that everyone is supportive and excited for improving it in the future as I know all of us involved in it behind the scenes are.</p>

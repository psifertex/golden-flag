		  <p>The Golden Flag Awards are a new tradition started at the end of 2014 to honor the best in the year's CTF challenges and events. This is a bit of an experiment and based on community feedback, it's possible things will change for next year. </p>
		  <p>The actual award ceremony will be held Saturday, January 17th at 1800 EST at the <a href="http://shmoocon.org/">ShmooCon conference</a> in Washington, DC, but will be streamed online.  Check back here for more information closer to the appointed time.</p>
